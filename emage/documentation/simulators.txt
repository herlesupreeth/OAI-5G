EMAge provides also some really base simulators that can be used as a learning
point on how to implement your own technology wrapper for the LTE stack in use.
Under the 'sim' folder you can find the usim (userspace simulator) and the 
uctrl(userspace controller) that will simulate the agent-controller standard
behavior.


USIM

Since EMAge comes in a library implementation, it cannot stand alone as it is, 
and must be embedded in another application. uSim provides an example of how an
application must embed the agent in order to make it work. The necessary code 
that must be integrated is kept minimal in order to have the less impacts as 
possible with existing architectures.

Under the 'tech' forlder you can find the uSim technology wrapper, which is the
implementation of the agent offered callback in a very dummy way. They usually
do nothing and just print on the console a feedback to inform that the message
has been successfully computed.


UCTRL

The EMAge controller is a more complex application which has to 'emulate' the
controller in it's communication part with the agent. The uctrl is really dummy,
and has been introduced for debugging purposes.

The controller is basically a CLI application which need a port in order to be 
run. When it successfully start, it just remain silents to agents to connect 
with it. The waiting states allow you to decide what to do, like for example
sending some commands to the connected agents.

NOTE: More than one agent can connect with he controller, but you will be able 
to send commands just to the last one which connected. This is a known 
limitation that will be resolved in the future releases.
